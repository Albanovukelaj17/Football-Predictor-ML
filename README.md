# Football Predictor ML

## Overview
The Football Predictor ML project aims to predict football match outcomes using historical match data. The project uses R for data analysis and machine learning to analyze various factors such as home and away goals, stadium advantages, and player statistics to make predictions.

## Project Structure
- **`main.R`**: The main script that ties together the data loading, analysis, and visualization.
- **`data_loading.R`**: Loads data from CSV files into R data frames.
- **`data_analysis.R`**: Performs analysis on the loaded data, such as calculating average home and away goals and analyzing the home advantage.
- **`visualization.R`**: Contains code for visualizing data insights, such as charts displaying home vs. away goals.
